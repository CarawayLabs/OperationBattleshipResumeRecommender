# Purpose: 
This markdown file provides an easy to read view of the chain that we implemented for the LLM to process a resume and return the information as a JSON Object. 

## LLM Used: 
- ChatGPT 3.5T
    - The complexity of our inference required from the LLM is pretty low. There's not a lot of complex tasks that we are asking for. ChatGPT 3.5T produces meanfingful results and value when processing relatively small documents and extracting key information in the document. 
    - Its also affordable! 

## Prompt Techniques
    - We specify the role that the LLM is to assume and also format of the response.
    - Few shot prompting. In order to improve the reliability and consitency of the LLMs ability to respond in JSON, we give it an example of its prior output. During testing, we found significant improvements in the quality of the responses. 
    - Chain of Thought Prompting. We favor accuracy and consistency over speed for this task. Telling the LLM to take its time has shown time and time again that the LLM will produce better results. 

## LLM Role
The LLM is given the role of expert hiring manager. 

## LLM Response Format:
We instruct the LLM to return its information as a JSON format so that we can easily parse this information and store it in the database for use in future functions of Operation Battleship. 
Title 
Previous Titles:  
Candidate Summary: This is a 4 paragraph summary about the job candidate. Share information about who they are, their skills and relevant experience. I don't have time to read every resume from top to bottom. So I need you to condense it to 4 paraphs. 
Candidate Skills: This is a collection of the skills that we can observe for this job candidate. We can eventually use this to compare against our open jobs. 
Resume Keywords: Please give me the top 10 keywords of the resume. Provide these as a collection. 
Candidate Excellence: An integer value of one to ten that describes how good this job candidate is based on their resume. 
Candidate Excellence Justification: Give a 2 paragraph justification about the score that you gave for the candidate's excellence.

### Your job: 
You must review resumes that I submit to you and provide information about these things:

Previous Titles: This is a collection of all previous job titles that a person has held before. 
Potential Furure Job Titles: This is a collection of 3 job titles that this candidate could potential explore as next moves in their career. This is helpful because I often have other roles that I am hiring for. I can compare this to other openings. It will also allow me to think about future growth opportunities for this candidate if I was to hire them.
